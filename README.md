3D Snake - Josh Bolitho


Game Description:

What is the main action in the game?

I mean, if you've played snake before, it's pretty much that! except you have to learn to use PgUp and PgDown to control the height from the regular 2d plane.


What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal?

Working out how to implement global variables, and dealing with rotations in 2D, and then in 3D. Conversely, the easiest part to get working was the 3D aspect. It occured to me that I might as well take my 3D-Rendered 2D snake game, and just give the player the option to move in and out of the plane of the screen. All I had to do was add 2 input buttons and fiddle with a rotation transform until it worked! 


What is the most interesting part of the game?

That it's 3d, I guess. It's not super interesting but dealing with the fact you have bounds in 6 directions can make the game more engaging. To my surprise, it ended up being a little bit fun once you get the hang of the controls :)
